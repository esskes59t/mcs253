The project is about how to know which learning preference is best for learners.
my code comprises of functions and attributes. class is created but no subclass and so inheritance is not applied
The data was captured in  a dictionary and exception is used.

so many challenges were encountered and did more researches and had discovered new things  
Finally I just want acknowledge the contributors to the project
